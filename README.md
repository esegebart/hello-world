# hello-world
Learning how to use GitHub and following the hello-world activities. 

I am using the guide to create another branch so different branches of the file can be worked on without affecting the master file. Only when changes are verified could they then be decided to commit to the master branch. 

I am a student right now going to Capella University and I love learning about programming. GitHub seems to be a relatively important resource in the industry and I hope learning it will be valuable to me.
